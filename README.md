# ODE-Final-Project

How to RUN:
1. Download the images and make sure that their names stay the same.
2. Download the code.
3. Unperturbed_simulation is code to simulate orbit with no perturbation. 
4. Drag_simulation is code to simulate orbit with drag.
5. Third-body_Perturbation is code to simulate orbit with a third-body gravitational pull
6. Upload the code you want to use into an IDE and upload the three images.
7. Make sure the images' names stay the same and the code should run smoothly
